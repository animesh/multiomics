CLL is accessible via the R package MOFAdata

If you have troubles installing it, download the packgage directly from the source forge with the link:
https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/src/contrib/MOFAdata_1.16.1.tar.gz

And then specify in rstudio the path of this tar.gz file.

Once install, use data("CLL_data") to load the data and data("CLL_covariates") to load the covariates.
